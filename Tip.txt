WiFi Password Viewer Tips
=========================

If you want to find the password for a Wi-Fi network that your PC is connected to, you can use the following method:

1. **Using Command Prompt (Windows):**
   - Open Command Prompt as an administrator.
   - Type the following command to list all saved Wi-Fi profiles:
     ```
     netsh wlan show profiles
     ```
   - To view the password for a specific network, type the following command, replacing `PROFILE_NAME` with the name of the Wi-Fi profile:
     ```
     netsh wlan show profile name="PROFILE_NAME" key=clear
     ```
   - Look for the `Key Content` field under `Security settings` to find the Wi-Fi password.

2. **Using the Wi-Fi Password Viewer Application:**
   - Install Python from https://www.python.org if you don't have it already.
   - Run the `wifi_password_viewer.py` script using the following command:
     ```
     python wifi_password_viewer.py
     ```
   - This will display all saved Wi-Fi network names and their passwords in an interactive GUI.

Note:
-----------------
These methods only display passwords for Wi-Fi networks saved on your PC. They do not crack or access passwords for networks that are not saved on your system.
